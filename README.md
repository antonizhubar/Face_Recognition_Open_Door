# Face_Recognition_Open_Door

This project was intended for my school for my first year of preparatory studies: Technology and Industrial Sciences.
This project consists in opening a door by detecting the face of the person on a vector plane x and y. (recommended to use plane on vectors 3 ( x, y, z) )

The project is not 100% efficient because sometimes the predictions are wrong due to lack of CPU, For my part on this project I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. It is recommended to use a micro controller such as Nvidia Jetson nano for this kind of project (AI).

I've posted some pictures of the representation of my project in the assets folder.


# What is my project and what does it do?

My project allows you to open a door without using a key only with face recognition.

# How does the code work?

First of all you need to install the libraries mentioned: dlib, face_recognition and more.

If you encounter any problems don't hesitate to open a issue.

If you want to test put a picture of your face in the faces folder.

# Materials Used for this project

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Module V2 Camera Raspberry Pi 
- Servo Motor (I wanted to use a solenoid)
- transformer 5v DC
- 7" Official Touch Screen 800x480
